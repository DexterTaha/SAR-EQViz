## :pushpin: About
[SAR-EQViz](https://dextertaha.github.io/SAR-EQViz/index.html) is a website that combines Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery & Drone scans to display the impact of the 2023 Moroccan earthquake. It is a revolutionary approach to post-seismic analysis and visualization. We developed an interactive digital art platform that serves as an educational tool, an advocacy platform, and a bridge between scientific data and public understanding.

## :pushpin: Motivation
The motivation behind SAR-EQViz lies in its capability to revolutionize post-seismic analysis and public understanding. In contrary, traditional assessment methods doesn't envolve public engagement and it's mainly focusing on isolated data sets. By merging SAR data with high resolution scan drones, SAR-EQViz transforms this chunks of information into an interactive digital art platform.

This platform serves multiple purposes: it educates the general public by bridging the often wide gap between complex scientific data and general comprehension, and advocates for targeted and efficient reconstructions. Users ranging from civil engineers and urban planners to local government agencies can use the platform to check transformations in earth and infrastructure post-earthquake. This facilitates more in-depth analysis and data-driven decision-making for reconstruction projects.

It not only bridges the gap between raw data and human stories but also empowers decision-makers with actionable insights for targeted rehabilitation plans.

## :pushpin: Development Process

- **Research and Conceptualization:** Brainstorming and laying the foundations of the project. The team identified the objectives and key requirements of the platform.

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** Searching and filtreing data sources to ensure its relevance to our project.
  
- **Visualization Design and Development:** designing the platform's visual component, ensuring that they are user-friendly and informative.

- **Refinement and Iteration:** makimg refinements and improvements to enhance the functionality of the website.

- **Documentation and Presentation:** preparing the project's documentation and presentation.
  
- **Final Touches and Submission:** making the final optimizations, bug fixes, and quality checks.

## :pushpin: Highlight and Features
### Data Integration
- **Multi-Source Imagery**: Integration of Sentinel-1 SAR and drone-scanned images.
- **Real-Time Updates**: update data sets in real-time for ongoing analysis.

### Visualization
- **Interactive Map**: Users can zoom in/out and pan across regions to study affected areas.
- **Land Displacement Metrics**: Visualization of land shifts using color-coded metrics.
- **3D Modeling**: Option to view affected areas in 3D, giving spatial context to the damage.



### Analytical Tools
- **Damage Assessment**: Automated algorithms to evaluate the extent of structural damage.
- **Reconstruction Planning**: identifying safe zones for rebuilding.

### Educational & Advocacy Aspects
- **Information Panels**: Clickable panels or tooltips providing educational content.
- **Public Sharing**: Options to share specific findings on social media.

## :pushpin: NASA Space Apps Challenge
SAR-EQViz has been specifically developed in response to the [NASA International Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/), and our project fits within the [Create a Work of SART (Synthetic Aperture Radar Art)](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/create-a-work-of-sart-synthetic-aperture-radar-art/) challenge.
