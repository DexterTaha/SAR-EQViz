Disclaimer: This project is currently under construction. Some features might not be fully functional. And was developed in response to <a href="https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/create-a-work-of-sart-synthetic-aperture-radar-art/">NASA International Space Apps Challenge</a> / <a href="https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/locations/tangier/">Tangier</a>

## :pushpin: About
SAR-EQViz is a revolutionary approach to post-seismic analysis and visualization. By showing land displacement data from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data and high-resolution, up-close drone scans. We developed an interactive digital art platform that serves as an educational tool, an advocacy platform, and a bridge between scientific data and public understanding.

Users such as civil engineers, urban planners, architects, and the local government can dynamically explore the affected regions, witnessing the post-earthquake land transformations, enabling them to conduct in-depth analysis and reconstruction plannings. The drone spotlights the urgent needs and challenges on the ground. 

It not only bridges the gap between raw data and human stories but also empowers decision-makers with actionable insights for targeted rehabilitation plans.

## :pushpin: Process

1. Collect various types of data: the source code and the details of what and how the data was collected can be found in <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/data/">data</a>.
2. Analyze, mix and visualize the data: the source code and the details of how the data was analyzed, mixed and visualized can also be found in both <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/data">data</a> and <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/src/">src</a> based on the datatype.
3. Code the data to be available in the user interface: the source code and the details of how the data was coded can be found in a <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/src">src</a>.
4. The user interface demo can be found detailed in <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/sample">sample</a>.
5. More details about the project description, work process, and current stage can be found in <a href="https://github.com/usmhic/Warmning/blob/main/doc">doc</a>.
