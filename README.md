  <h2>:pushpin: About</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://dextertaha.github.io/SAR-EQViz/index.html">SAR-EQViz</a> is a website that combines Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery & Drone scans to display the impact of the 2023 Moroccan earthquake. It is a revolutionary approach to post-seismic analysis and visualization. We developed an interactive digital art platform that serves as an educational tool, an advocacy platform, and a bridge between scientific data and public understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>:pushpin: Motivation</h2>
  <p>
    The motivation behind SAR-EQViz lies in its capability to revolutionize post-seismic analysis and public understanding. In contrary, traditional assessment methods doesn't involve public engagement and it's mainly focusing on isolated data sets. By merging SAR data with high-resolution scan drones, SAR-EQViz transforms this chunks of information into an interactive digital art platform.
  </p>

  <p>This platform serves multiple purposes: it educates the general public by bridging the often wide gap between complex scientific data and general comprehension, and advocates for targeted and efficient reconstructions. Users ranging from civil engineers and urban planners to local government agencies can use the platform to check transformations in earth and infrastructure post-earthquake. This facilitates more in-depth analysis and data-driven decision-making for reconstruction projects.</p>
