[SAR-EQViz](https://dextertaha.github.io/SAR-EQViz/index.html) is a website that combines Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery & Drone scans to display the impact of the 2023 Moroccan earthquake, guiding and optimizing reconstruction efforts.

## :pushpin: About
SAR-EQViz is a revolutionary approach to post-seismic analysis and visualization. By showing land displacement data from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data and high-resolution, up-close drone scans. We developed an interactive digital art platform that serves as an educational tool, an advocacy platform, and a bridge between scientific data and public understanding.

Users such as civil engineers, urban planners, architects, and the local government can dynamically explore the affected regions, witnessing the post-earthquake land transformations, enabling them to conduct in-depth analysis and reconstruction plannings. The drone spotlights the urgent needs and challenges on the ground. 

It not only bridges the gap between raw data and human stories but also empowers decision-makers with actionable insights for targeted rehabilitation plans.

## :pushpin: Motivation
The motivation behind SAR-EQViz lies in its capability to revolutionize post-seismic analysis and public understanding. In contrary, traditional assessment methods doesn't envolve public engagement and it is mainly focusing on isolated data sets. By merging SAR data with high resolution scan drones, SAR-EQViz transforms this chunks of information into an interactive digital art platform.

This platform serves multiple purposes: it educates the general public by bridging the often wide gap between complex scientific data and general comprehension, and advocates for targeted and efficient reconstructions. Users ranging from civil engineers and urban planners to local government agencies can use the platform to check transformations in earth and infrastructure post-earthquake. This facilitates more in-depth analysis and data-driven decision-making for reconstruction projects.

## :pushpin: Development Process

- **Research and Conceptualization:** At this initial stage, the foundation for the project is laid. Ideas are brainstormed, and initial concepts are outlined. The team identifies the objectives and key requirements of the platform.

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** After defining the project scope, the team delves into relevant data sources. The data is explored, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure its quality and relevance to the project's goals.

- **Visualization Design and Development:** With the data ready, the team shifts focus to designing the platform's visual components. Data visualizations are developed, ensuring that they are intuitive, user-friendly, and informative.

- **Refinement and Iteration:** Post the initial design phase, the project undergoes several rounds of refinements. Feedback is collected, and iterative improvements are made to enhance functionality, usability, and visual appeal.

- **Documentation and Presentation:** Concurrently, comprehensive documentation is prepared, outlining the platform's features, functionalities, and benefits. A presentation is also crafted to showcase the project to potential stakeholders and the wider audience.

- **Final Touches and Submission:** The project concludes with final optimizations, bug fixes, and quality checks. Once everything is in place, SAR-EQViz is finalized for submission, ensuring it aligns perfectly with the goals set out at the start.
