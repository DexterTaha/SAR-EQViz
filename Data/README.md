## Introduction

The SAR-EQViz project aimed to use Sentinel-1 SAR data to provide an overview visualization of the impact of earthquakes, specifically focusing on the 2023 Moroccan one.

## Intended Data Usage

Our initial approach intended for the direct utilization of Sentinel-1 SAR data for the following purposes:
- **Visualization**: Crafting high-definition representations of the earthquake's impact.
- **Analysis**: Identifying and quantifying land displacements and transformations.
- **Integration**: Combining the SAR data with drone scans for a comprehensive view.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Uncommon Nature of SAR Data**: SAR data, while powerful, is not widely used in many regions, especially for civil applications.
2. **Data Accessibility in Morocco**: Obtaining SAR data specifically for Morocco proved to be particularly challenging due to the limited availability and accessibility.
3. **Lack of Expertise**: Given that no one of our team members is a data scientist, using and treating the SAR data was challenging.
4. **Time Constraints**: The limited time available for the project limited our ability to extensively process the datasets.

## Current Data Solution

Instead of direct SAR data, we utilized a treated and processed photo from [sentinel-1](https://www.esa.int/esearch?q=Sentinel-1), as a resource to serve as a placeholder and demonstration of the visualization capabilities we aimed to achieve. While this isn't a direct replacement, it provides an insight into our vision and the potential of SAR-EQViz once the intended data becomes accessible.
